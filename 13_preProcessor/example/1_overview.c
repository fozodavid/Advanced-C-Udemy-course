// Preprocessor
//
// First step before compliling, not part of the compiler
//
// Performs 3 tasks on the code
//
// 1. Removes all the comments
// 2. Includes all of the files from the libraries that the program needs to compile
// 3. Expansion of macro definitions
//
// Preprocessor Directives
//
// commands that begin with the # symbol
// must be the first nonblank character
// should begin in the first column
//
// Preprocessor Operators
// * Help in the creation of macros
// * they are used in the context of #define directive
