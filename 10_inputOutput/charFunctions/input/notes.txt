Originally input/output were not part of the definition of C
  the Unix implementation of C has served as a model for these functions

three files are automatically opened by the system for use by the program:
  stdin, stdout, stderr defined in <stdio.h>

  stdin is the terminal window
  stdout also terminal window
  stderr most of the error messages are written to this file also terminal
